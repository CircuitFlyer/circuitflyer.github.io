<p><strong>This is where I share some of my electronics hobby projects related to electric powered control line model airplanes</strong></p>

<p>Iâ€™d like to share some of my electronics hobby projects with fellow electric control line flying enthusiasts.</p>

<p>Listed below are some of my open source electronic hobby projects that you can build for yourself.</p>

<p>These projects are based around popular off-the-shelf microcontroller development boards that are easy to assemble and even easier to program</p>

<p>a timer project for the 21 century.</p>
