<p><strong>Where electonics hobby projects intersect with electric control line model airplanes</strong></p>

<p>I’d like to share some of my electronics hobby projects with electric control line flying enthusiasts.</p>

<p>Here you will find some of my electronic hobby projects that you can build.</p>

<p>Listed below are some of my open source electronic hobby projects that you can build for yourself.</p>

<p>These projects are based around popular off-the-shelf microcontroller developmemt boards that are easy to asssemble and even easier to program</p>

<p>a timer project for the 21 century.</p>
