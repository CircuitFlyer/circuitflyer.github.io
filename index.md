## Welcome to the Circuitflyer Home Page

**Where electonics hobby projects intersect with electric control line model airplanes**

I'd like to share some of my electronics hobby projects with electric control line flying enthusiasts.

Here you will find some of my electronic hobby projects that you can build.

Listed below are some of my open source electronic hobby projects that you can build for yourself.

These projects are based around popular off-the-shelf microcontroller developmemt boards that are easy to asssemble and even easier to program

a timer project for the 21 century.
