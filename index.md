### **This is where I share some of my electronics hobby projects related to electric powered control line model airplanes**

<br>

**Listed below are some open source projects that you can build for yourself.  Using popular off-the-shelf microcontroller development boards, they are easy to assemble and even easier to program.**

## A Basic Timer

**The *Touch_and_Go* timer is a very low cost simple timer that is easy to make and install with minimal components.  It's easy to operate and covers all of the requirements to get you in the air quickly.**<br>

## An Advanced Timer

**The *Climb_and_Dive* timer builds on the simple timer concept by adding an additional circuit board.  This not only simplifies wiring but allows for some amazing features not found in any other timer.  Wireless programming via Bluetooth!**<br>
