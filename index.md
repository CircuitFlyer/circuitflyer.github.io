## Welcome to the CircuitFlyer Home Page

**Where my electronics hobby projects intersect with electric control line model airplanes**

I'd like to share some of my electronics hobby projects with fellow electric control line flying enthusiasts.

Here you will find some of my electronic hobby projects that you can build.

Listed below are some of my open source electronic hobby projects that you can build for yourself.

These projects are based around popular off-the-shelf microcontroller development boards that are easy to assemble and even easier to program

a timer project for the 21 century.

> ## I'd like to think of it as **electric control line for the 21st century**
