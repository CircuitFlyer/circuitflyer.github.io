## Welcome to the CircuitFlyer Home Page

### **This is where I share some of my electronics hobby projects related to electric powered control line model airplanes**

<br>

**Listed below are some of my open source projects that you can build for yourself.**

**Using popular off-the-shelf microcontroller development boards they are easy to assemble and even easier to program.**


## Basic Timer

The Touch_and_Go timer is a very low cost simple timer that is easy to make and install with minimal components.  It's easy to operate and covers all of the requirements to get you in the air quickly.<br>
