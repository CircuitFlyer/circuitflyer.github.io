## About Me
{: .text-center }

*Who is CircuitFlyer?*  It's me, Paul Emmerson.  A retired old guy that loves to tinker, learn new things and fly control line model airplanes.  No, I'm not an embedded systems engineer nor a great programmer.  I'm not even a great stunt flyer.  I just love to experiment and sometimes learn things the hard way.<br>

Sharing what I have learned is my way of giving back to the hobby I enjoy.  The intent of an open source project is to encourage other people to build upon and add to the project while continuing to share their efforts in the same manner.<br>

*Why go to all trouble of making your own, when you could just buy one?*  The electronics field changes very fast.  Newer, faster and better microcontrollers are always being released.  I feel that the current timers that are commercially available for a reasonable cost are dated and have limited capabilities.  I also feel that the cost of some timers and their programmers could restrict newcomers to the hobby.  Having more options is a good thing.<br>
