## About Me
{: .text-center }

Who is CircuitFlyer?  It's me, Paul Emmerson.  A retired OG that loves to tinker, learn new things and fly control line model airplanes.  No, I'm not an embedded systems engineer nor a great programmer.  I'm not even a great stunt flyer either.  I just love to experiment and sometimes learn things the hard way.<br>

Sharing what I have learned is my way of giving back to the hobby I enjoy.
