If you are new to electric powered control line here is a quick simplified overview of how it all works.<br>

## Motor

The motor of choice is a brushless outrunner motor.  In a brushless motor the commutation of the current to the motor windings takes place outside the motor by a separate electronic device called an electronic speed controller or ESC for short.  In an outrunner motor the rotors permanent magnets rotate around the outside of the stationary copper motor windings and iron core.  The motor has three wires, one for each set of windings, connected to the ESC with 'bullet' style connectors.<br>

## Battery

The most popular battery used today is the lithium-polymer (Lipo) battery.  The number of cells (at 3.7 volts each) determines the nominal battery voltage.  The capacity is measured in milli-amp-hours (mAh).  The maximum discharge rating of a battery is expressed as a 'C' rate.  A 20C or 25C rating is sufficient for control line use.  The style of connector used on the battery can vary and is a matter of personal preference.<br>
