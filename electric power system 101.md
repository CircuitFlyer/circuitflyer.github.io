The motor of choice is a DC brushless outrunner motor.  DC - direct current, ideal for battery operation.  Brushless - the commutation of the current to the motor windings takes place outside the motor by a separate electronic device.  Outrunner - the rotor permanent magnets rotate around the outside of the stationary copper motor windings and iron core.<br>
